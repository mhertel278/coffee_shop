## EDA and Data Cleaning as necessary

- Check for nulls in any table

- Check for duplicates, either complete row dups or dups of specific IDs

### Transactions Table

    - Duplicate transaction_ids. Each store on each day seems to start new count. Also same transaction can have multiple line items, one for each different product regardless of how many units of the product (ie can have 2 coffees on one line but not 1 coffee and one tea)

    - no dups
